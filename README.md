# Mixpanel Tracking Proxy

A lightweight nginx-based HTTP proxy server that acts as an intermediary between your applications and Mixpanel's tracking API endpoints.

## What it does

This proxy forwards tracking requests from your applications to Mixpanel while preserving client IP addresses for accurate geolocation tracking. It handles requests to:

- `/lib.min.js` and `/lib.js` - Mixpanel JavaScript library files
- `/decide` - Mixpanel's feature flag and A/B testing endpoint  
- `/` - All other Mixpanel API endpoints (tracking, ingestion, etc.)

## Why use a proxy

- **Client IP preservation**: Maintains accurate geolocation data in your Mixpanel events
- **Avoid ad blockers**: Routes tracking through your own domain instead of mixpanel.com
- **Data residency compliance**: Configurable endpoints for EU and IN data residency requirements
- **First-party tracking**: Enables tracking from your own domain for better reliability
