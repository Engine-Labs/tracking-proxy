# Tracking Proxy

A lightweight Nginx-based proxy server for analytics tracking that forwards requests to analytics service endpoints while preserving client information and bypassing common tracking restrictions.

## What it does

This proxy server acts as an intermediary between client applications and analytics services (specifically Mixpanel), providing:

- **IP Preservation**: Maintains original client IP addresses for accurate geo-location tracking
- **Ad-blocker Bypass**: Routes tracking requests through your domain to avoid ad-blocker restrictions
- **Request Forwarding**: Proxies requests to:
  - Analytics ingestion API endpoints
  - JavaScript tracking libraries
  - Decision/configuration endpoints

## How it works

The proxy uses Nginx to forward requests to the appropriate analytics service endpoints:

- `/` - Routes to the main analytics API for event ingestion
- `/lib.js` and `/lib.min.js` - Serves analytics JavaScript libraries
- `/decide` - Handles analytics configuration and feature flag requests

The configuration includes special handling for Cloudflare and various hosting providers to ensure client IP addresses are properly forwarded for geo-location tracking.

## Deployment

The project includes a Dockerfile for containerized deployment and configuration files for various cloud providers. Simply deploy the Docker container or copy the Nginx configuration to your existing server.
