# Mixpanel Tracking Proxy (Fork)

This is a forked version of the Mixpanel tracking proxy server. This repository provides a lightweight nginx-based HTTP proxy that acts as an intermediary between client applications and Mixpanel's API endpoints.

## Status

This is a temporary placeholder for the forked repository. Detailed documentation and configuration instructions will be added in future updates.

## Original Repository

This fork is based on the official Mixpanel tracking proxy implementation. For complete documentation and setup instructions, please refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/mixpanel/tracking-proxy) until this fork is fully documented.
